## Transferring Knowledge Across Regions: Domain Adaptation for Super-Resolution Km-Scale Models

This study compares different domain adaptation techniques to improve the generalization of downscaling models. Downscaling is crucial for enhancing the spatial and temporal resolution of weather and climate projections, facilitating more accurate regional impact assessments and supporting informed decision-making in agriculture, water management, and risk modelling. We focus on super-resolution techniques where low-resolution inputs are transformed into high-resolution outputs for variables like temperature, humidity, pressure, and precipitation. Specifically, we apply blurring to a 10-year, storm-resolving COSMO simulation over Europe, reducing the horizontal grid spacing to approximately 12 km before downscaling it back to the original 2.2 km resolution. To improve model generalization across unseen topographical conditions, we implement domain adaptation techniques evaluating the performance through tailored spatial evaluation metrics such as the Structure-Amplitude-Location (SAL) metric and the Fractions Skill Score (FSS). We hypothesize that domain adaptation will lead to superior generalization across diverse terrains, improved data efficiency, and better convergence, outperforming standard domain adaptation techniques such as Dropout and Batch Normalization. These models will ideally learn transferable mapping, allowing high-quality data from well-studied regions to enhance predictions in data-sparse areas. Additionally, we believe this approach may facilitate the discovery of more general relationships between mesoscale and storm-scale thermodynamic environments, improving the broader applicability of deep learning-based downscaling methods.
